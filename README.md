A pacman clone where the enemies are slower than you, but make up for it better teamwork. Enemies follow your 'heat signature', and avoid the heat signatures of other enemies, thus effectively working together to corner you.

To beat each level you have to eat all the pellets. If you die, the positions of all entities are reset, and you lose a life. Once all lives are lost, the game is over. If you beat all the levels without dying, you win the game.
